# Introduction
It is not uncommon for video games to have some kind of combo system and maybe in some cases, needing to perform heavy computations while keeping the system responsive. This is the last tutorial where we use our starter Mario project, before we expand our knowledge in 3D games with another starter project. Hopefully by the end of this tutorial, you have more than enough knowledge to implement the basic Super Mario Bros game and beyond.
